				<p>It can be assembled on three-phase electric meter test bench for active and reactive calibration of static meters. It will help to raise working efficiency.</p>
				
				<h3>Features:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Integrated two pulse-sensors in one scanning probe, active and reactive sensors can be aligned respectively. </li>
					<li>Distance between two probes can be adjusted through screw stem, with range available from 12 to 45mm.</li>
					<li>Auxiliary light is designed to assist aiming during adjusting. </li>
					<li>LED indicators of active and reactive flicker synchronously with the pulses.</li>
					<li>Two transmitting channels of bench are required for active and reactive pulses transmitting simultaneously.</li>
					<li>Distance of front side of scanning probe to LED pulse source is 25mmÂ±10mm.</li>
					<li>Any kind of plugs are available for ordering, refer to Sample List of Connectors for Optical Scanning Probes > from Tespro web-site.</li>
				</ul>




				<h3>Connector</h3>
					<p>RJ11 with 4-pin connector is the default</p>
				<h3>Options</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Magnetic adhesion is available as an option</li>
					<li>Ear-phone connector or any other connector is available as an option. </li>
